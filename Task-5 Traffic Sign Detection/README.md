## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can detect and classify different traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Dataset
The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is used for this project. The dataset contains 43 different classes of traffic signs with more than 50,000 images in total. The dataset is available for download from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.

## Approach
The following approach is used for this project:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset

2. Build and train the CNN model on the training dataset

3. Evaluate the model on the validation dataset

4. Fine-tune the model if required

5. Test the model on the test dataset

6. Save the model for future use


## Results
The model was able to achieve an accuracy of around 98% on the test dataset. The model was able to detect and classify different traffic signs with high accuracy.


## Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully built a deep learning model that can detect and classify different traffic signs with high accuracy. This model can be used in various applications related to traffic management and safety.
